# CCIcalc
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) Score Calculator
Estimating Prognosis for Dialysis Patients
Programmed by: Mostafa Mohamed on March 21, 2015
Live example is setup on Google could engine at: http://main-element-89114.appspot.com/?age=55&factors=MI,CVA,dementia,COPD 

The repository contains a function written in Python programming language in the file "ccicalc.py".
To call it you must pass in the patient ages as the first parameter then all patient conditions as a list of parameters as follows:
```Python
	ccicalc(age, *args)
```    
The conditions can be passed as a one string or list of strings as:
```Python
	e.g.: ccicalc(55, 'MI, CVA, dementia, COPD')

	or    ccicalc(55, 'MI', 'CVA', 'dementia', 'COPD')
``` 
The function will clean-up the parameters list to remove duplicates and unknown inputs.
The function returns the result in text form as follows:
```
	"Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) Score: 4 Age factored in: 5."
```
The list of input arguments for patient conditions is divided into 4 sets as listed below:
